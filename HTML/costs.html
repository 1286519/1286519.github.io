  <h3><u>Acceptance Fee - £99</u></h3>

  Once you have completed your interview, your interviewer will write up your interview notes and attach them to your application. After this, you will then be asked to pay the acceptance fee of £99 and also complete all three references along with your application video. Once all of this has been done your application will then circulate over to our Camp Directors in Canada who are actively seeking amazing staff for this Summer! When a Camp likes the look of your application you will be put on what is called ‘review’. You may be asked to have a Skype or phone call with the Camp Director or you may get placed straight away!
